4096 memory locations (bytes),
interpreter itself uses first 512 bytes,
most programs begin at 512 for this reason
uppermost 512 bytes reserved for display refresh,
96 bytes below reserved for call stack, internal use,
and other variables

registers V0 - VF
VF register doubles as a flag for instructions
in addition, VF is the carry flag
in subtraction, VF is the 'no borrow flag'
in drawing, VF is set upon pixel collision

address register, named I, is 12 bits wide,
used with several opcodes that involve memory operations



variables / symbols:

NNN: address
NN: 8 bit constant
N: 4 bit constant
X and Y: 4-bit register identifier
PC: program counter
I: 12bit register for memory, similar to void *
VN: one of 16 available variables. N may be 0 to F
